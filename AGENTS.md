# Agent Behaviour

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding
mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions
as needed.

Tradeoff: These guidelines bias toward caution
over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing.

## 2. Simplicity First

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No “flexibility” that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it.

## 3. Surgical Changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

- Don't “improve” adjacent code or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- “Add validation” → “Write tests, then make them pass”
- “Fix the bug” → “Reproduce it in a test, then fix”
- “Refactor X” → “Ensure tests pass before and after”
